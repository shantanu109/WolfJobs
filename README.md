# WolfJobs
Need a side Hustle or want to get some quick rewards? Wolfjobs provides the perfect platform to meet your requirements.

A job portal which provides recruiters a platform to post temporary job openings and an oppurtunity for candidates to apply for the jobs without being concerned about permanent associations. 

# Why WolfJobs?
Unlike the Job Portals that display only Permanent job positions, WolfJob focuses on providing Temporary positions to anyone who wants to work for a limited period of time.

Be it a short-time Technical requirement or hiring a short-term Cashier for a dining place, WolfJobs covers it all! 
Every user associated with WolfJobs has a choice to Post a job or Apply for a job. WolfJobs provides a universal account for a specific user so that He/She can manage the applications as well as job postings efficiently!

Let's say that a Teaching Assistant is going on a vacation and needs a pair of hands to grade a particular exam having many students. He/She can post a requirement in WolfJobs stating the pay/rewards for the job. 
Let's assume the same Teaching Assistant has some free time and want to know if there are any temporary requirements for grading any other course. Thus, He/She can search the jobs in WolfJobs and apply for the same.

# Installation Guide
 
 - Download the Allow CORS: Access-Control-Allow-Origin extension for Google Chrome to allow requests to be sent between the frontend and backend
 
 - In phase 3 we simplified the install process: Thus you just need to run the following Docker command to run the repo:
#### `docker-compose up --build`

- Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
 
# Additional commands for React App

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

# Future Scope
  
  1.	**Job Analysis** – In phase 3, wolf Job will provide the functionality of analysing various aspects of a job. Job Analysis based on various parameters using graphical representation will help in making prediction on which jobs are more preferred and for which jobs applicants have more inclination. Hiring managers can then decide what rewards and salary to be given to the applicants of that job. Even applicants will get to know, which job is being preferred among other applicants.

  2.	**OTP and Email Verification** – In the 3rd phase, wolf Job will provide the functionality to verify an end user by 2-way authentication, that is, Authentication via OTP as well as email verification.

  3.	**Chatbot Integration** – Our platform Wolf Job will also provide the functionality of Chatbot integrated with our website so that user can easily interact with the bot and get to know about various features of our web application and have a nice interactive experience.

  4.	**Interview Appointment Scheduling** – In future phase 3, Wolf Job will also provide the facility for the hiring manager to organize an interview appointment for the job based on applicant’s availability and convenient time uploaded by the hiring manager. Either of the users can upload their availability time in the G-sheet and using google calendar appointments can be organised.

# Changes from Project 2
* Added a message when creating job listings as a manager to indicate success or failure of creation
* Added extra dropdown in the login process to resolve the bug when creating a manager account
* Added listings on the homepage to indicate common attributes across listed jobs (location and pay)
* Combined both repositories (frontend and backend) into a single repository and setup launch with docker-compose
